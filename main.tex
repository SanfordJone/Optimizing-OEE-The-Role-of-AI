\section{Introduction}
The goal of the manufacturing sector is to maximise operational effectiveness and output. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) performance indicator is one of the most important factors in assessing and enhancing manufacturing performance. Availability, performance, and quality are the three main factors that OEE takes into account when calculating the effectiveness and efficiency of equipment utilisation. For manufacturers to increase productivity, decrease downtime, and reach greater levels of operational excellence, maximising OEE is crucial.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have recently emerged, creating new opportunities for revolutionising manufacturing processes. The potential for optimising different elements of industrial processes has been greatly proven by AI, which has the capacity to analyse enormous volumes of data, identify patterns, and make intelligent judgements. Due to this, there is an increasing interest in investigating how AI approaches might be used to boost OEE and reach new efficiencies.

Manufacturers have access to a potent toolset through the use of AI and OEE to spot inefficiencies, detect and stop equipment breakdowns, improve manufacturing procedures, and guarantee product quality. Manufacturers may obtain useful insights from real-time data, adopt proactive maintenance programmes, minimise unscheduled downtime, and make data-driven choices to maximise equipment utilisation by using the power of AI.

This study explores the relationship between AI and OEE and offers a thorough examination of how AI approaches are used into the enhancement of OEE. This paper seeks to examine the various applications of AI in different facets of OEE enhancement, such as predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, root cause analysis, process optimisation, and quality control. It does this by reviewing existing literature, exploring case studies, and analysing empirical data.

This study paper will also examine the advantages and difficulties of incorporating AI in OEE enhancement. It will go over the possible benefits of AI, including better decision-making, boosted productivity, and optimised maintenance procedures. The paper will also discuss the difficulties of using AI, such as workforce adaption, cost, and data quality.

Manufacturers may develop wise judgments and practical methods to improve equipment effectiveness, achieve better levels of productivity, and maintain competitiveness in today's quickly changing industrial environment by developing a greater awareness of the progress of AI and OEE. For manufacturers and researchers looking to use AI for OEE enhancement and to spark the next phase of industrial change, this study intends to offer insightful analysis, useful advice, and implications for the future.

\section{Literature Review}
An important performance metric in the industrial industry is OEE, or overall equipment effectiveness. Numerous studies have stressed its importance in identifying bottlenecks, monitoring and improving equipment efficiency, and increasing total production. When calculating OEE, availability, performance, and quality are frequently taken into consideration.

The literature may contain many OEE definitions and computing methods. Overall, it is generally acknowledged that performance evaluates how quickly or quickly equipment operates, quality verifies that output complies with specifications, and availability assesses how closely actual production times match expectations. These three variables are compounded together to obtain the OEE score, which gauges the equipment's overall effectiveness.


To far, a number of research publications have investigated how artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to improve OEE and transform industrial processes. Machine learning, predictive analytics, and data mining are examples of AI technologies that have considerable promise for improving many facets of OEE and solving production problems.

Predictive maintenance is one field where AI has made substantial advances. Manufacturers may foresee equipment breakdowns and plan maintenance in advance by using AI algorithms to analyse real-time sensor data, past maintenance records, and other pertinent parameters. With a proactive approach, unexpected downtime is reduced, equipment availability is increased, and equipment longevity is increased.


Another area where AI has showed promise in enhancing OEE is real-time monitoring. AI algorithms may identify abnormalities and inform operators or automatically change machine settings to optimise performance by continually monitoring a variety of metrics, including temperature, vibration, and energy usage. Cycle durations are shortened, scrap is minimised, and overall equipment performance is improved thanks to this real-time optimisation.

Another area where AI methods have been used to raise OEE is root cause analysis. AI algorithms can assist in determining the underlying causes of equipment breakdowns or performance problems by examining past data and spotting patterns. Manufacturers can then apply process changes, take remedial action, and stop future occurrences of the same type of mishap.


The literature has begun to pay more attention to process optimisation using AI. By locating inefficiencies, reducing waste, and maximising resource utilisation, manufacturers may improve their manufacturing processes via the use of sophisticated analytics and AI algorithms. AI-based optimisation approaches make it easier to increase productivity and guarantee seamless operations.

Another crucial component of OEE is quality control, where AI has been very helpful. To find flaws in goods, categorise them, and guarantee that quality standards are being followed, AI algorithms may analyse data from a variety of sources, including sensors, cameras, and quality inspection devices. This AI-driven quality control helps decrease the number of flawed units, raise the standard of the product, and increase the overall efficacy of the machinery.


Although there are many advantages to integrating AI into OEE, there are also a number of difficulties and restrictions. These include the availability and quality of data, the cost of implementation, the need for qualified labour, and potential workplace opposition to change. To fully realise the promise of AI in OEE enhancement, these issues must be resolved.

In summary, the research shows that there is significant interest in using AI approaches to raise OEE in the industrial sector. In terms of enhancing equipment efficiency and overall manufacturing performance, the use of AI in predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, root cause analysis, process optimisation, and quality control has shown encouraging results. However, further investigation is required to examine cutting-edge AI methods, handle implementation issues, and weigh the long-term effects of AI-driven OEE enhancement.


\section{Methodology}
In order to better understand how artificial intelligence (AI) may be incorporated into manufacturing industries to increase Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), this study article takes a mixed-methods approach. A thorough assessment of the available literature and an empirical analysis of case studies make up the methodology's two primary parts.

To find current studies, research papers, and industry reports that analyse the integration of AI in OEE improvement, a thorough literature study is the first step in the research process. To find pertinent material, many academic databases are checked, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and ScienceDirect. To provide thorough coverage of the topic, terminology like "OEE," "Artificial Intelligence," "AI," "manufacturing," and "efficiency" are employed.


The literature review contributes to the development of a theoretical framework and offers highlights the information that is currently available on the use of AI to increase OEE. It enables the identification of crucial ideas, approaches, and conclusions from earlier investigations. The empirical analysis step is developed using the summarised data from the literature review as a foundation.

In order to better understand the application and effects of AI in improving OEE, case studies and empirical data will be analysed in the second stage of the project. Based on factors including the availability of data, the variety of AI approaches used, and the representativeness of OEE improvement results, a selection of pertinent case studies from various sectors is made.


Relevant data are gathered for each case study, including details on the manufacturing process, equipment used, AI approaches used, implementation tactics, and gains in OEE as a result. Key staff interviews, access to production records, and cooperation with industry partners are just a few examples of data gathering techniques. During the data gathering process, all essential ethical guidelines and data anonymization procedures are followed.

The gathered information is subsequently subjected to both qualitative and quantitative examination. Finding common themes, patterns, and difficulties that emerge from the case studies is the goal of qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis focuses on calculating the percentage increases in availability, performance, and quality indicators that were made possible by the integration of AI in order to quantify the OEE benefits.


The empirical analysis stage enables a more thorough investigation of the applications, advantages, and difficulties connected with the application of AI in OEE enhancement. It offers insightful information about actual situations and either supports or disputes the conclusions of the literature research.

It is critical to recognize the limits of this practice. The chosen case studies might not cover the whole range of AI applications for OEE enhancement, and the conclusions might depend on the situation. The depth and scope of the empirical research may also be constrained by restrictions on data accessibility and availability. To counteract these constraints, efforts have been undertaken to assure a wide range of case studies and reliable data analysis methods.


This study article uses a mixed-methods approach to give a full knowledge of the integration of AI in OEE enhancement by combining a thorough literature review with empirical analysis. The technique used guarantees the investigation of theoretical and practical issues, providing insightful findings and recommendations for manufacturers and academics looking to use AI to improve the efficiency of machinery and the performance of whole production processes.


\section{OEE: Concepts and Measurement}
A key indicator used in the industrial sector to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of equipment utilisation is overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). It highlights opportunities for improvement, offers insightful information on how well manufacturing processes are working, and promotes operational excellence. Three important factors are taken into account while calculating OEE: availability, performance, and quality.


\subsection{Availability}
Availability compares the actual production time to the planned production time. It takes into account any unforeseen equipment downtime, such as failures, replacements, and maintenance procedures. A high availability percentage means that the machinery is continually functioning and ready for use.

The availability can be calculated using the following formula:
\vspace{0.3cm}
\[
\text{Availability} = \frac{\text{Operating Time - Downtime}}{\text{Operating Time}}
\]

\subsection{Performance}
Performance measures how quickly or slowly a piece of equipment uses up its designed capacity. It considers elements like the speed of the machinery, the cycle time, and the output rate. Performance loss may be brought on by inefficient operations, slower pace, or poor equipment performance.

The performance can be calculated using the following formula:
\vspace{0.3cm}
\[
\text{Performance} = \frac{\text{Ideal Cycle Time} \times \text{Total Count}}{\text{Operating Time}}
\]

\subsection{Quality}
The degree to which the result conforms to intended standards or client needs is referred to as quality. It takes into account any other quality-related difficulties, such as the quantity of faulty units, rework, or scrap. Low numbers of damaged units and few quality-related interruptions are indicators of a high quality percentage.

The quality can be calculated using the following formula:
\vspace{0.3cm}
\[
\text{Quality} = \frac{\text{Total Count - Defective Count}}{\text{Total Count}}
\]

After calculating the percentages for availability, performance, and quality, the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) score is generated by multiplying all three numbers together.
The formula for calculating OEE is as follows:
\vspace{0.3cm}
\[
\text{OEE} = \text{Availability} \times \text{Performance} \times \text{Quality}
\]

A perfect OEE score is 100\%, indicating that the equipment operates at its maximum capacity without any downtime, performs at the designed speed, and produces only high-quality output. However, achieving a perfect score is often challenging in real-world manufacturing environments.

The OEE metric provides manufacturers with a comprehensive understanding of how effectively their equipment is being utilized. It enables them to identify areas of improvement and prioritize initiatives to enhance equipment effectiveness. By analyzing the individual components of OEE (availability, performance, and quality), manufacturers can pinpoint specific areas for optimization and develop targeted strategies to improve overall equipment performance.

It is important to note that while OEE is a valuable metric, it has certain limitations. OEE focuses primarily on the equipment-related aspects of manufacturing performance and does not consider other factors such as material quality, workforce efficiency, or external disruptions. Therefore, it is crucial to complement OEE analysis with other performance metrics and contextual information to gain a holistic understanding of manufacturing operations.

In conclusion, OEE is a fundamental metric for evaluating equipment effectiveness in manufacturing. By considering availability, performance, and quality, manufacturers can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing their equipment's efficiency. The OEE calculation provides a quantifiable measure of manufacturing performance, enabling organizations to identify areas for improvement, implement targeted strategies, and drive continuous improvement initiatives.
